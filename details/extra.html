            <h4>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h4>
            <h5 style="text-align: center;">AI has had a lion's share of my IT learning path as I enjoyed working on different projects and joining multiple hackathons related to this field.</h5>

        <li>
            <h4>Aeronautics, Aerospace and Embedded Systems</h4>
            <h5 style="text-align: center;">A field I enjoyed and did for fun, and even had the chance to participate in nearly 5 competitions in the field of aeronautics ranging from gliders to RC planes.
                                            I've also had the privilege to work on some projects related to VTOLs and DRONES, putting in practise my electronics knowledge.
